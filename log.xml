                    Anecdote of the Jar
</title>
<text>
                    I placed a jar in Tennessee,&lt;br&gt;
 And round it was, upon a hill.&lt;br&gt;
 It made the slovenly wilderness&lt;br&gt;
 Surround that hill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The wilderness rose up to it,&lt;br&gt;
 And sprawled around, no longer wild.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was round upon the ground&lt;br&gt;
 And tall and of a port in air.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 It took dominion everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was gray and bare.&lt;br&gt;
 It did not give of bird or bush,&lt;br&gt;
 Like nothing else in Tennessee.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan&lt;br&gt;
 Of tan with henna hackles, halt!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Damned universal cock, as if the sun&lt;br&gt;
 Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal.&lt;br&gt;
 Your world is you. I am my world.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat!&lt;br&gt;
 Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines,&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs,&lt;br&gt;
 And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
