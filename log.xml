                    Anecdote of the Jar
</title>
<text>
                    I placed a jar in Tennessee,&lt;br&gt;
 And round it was, upon a hill.&lt;br&gt;
 It made the slovenly wilderness&lt;br&gt;
 Surround that hill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The wilderness rose up to it,&lt;br&gt;
 And sprawled around, no longer wild.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was round upon the ground&lt;br&gt;
 And tall and of a port in air.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 It took dominion everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was gray and bare.&lt;br&gt;
 It did not give of bird or bush,&lt;br&gt;
 Like nothing else in Tennessee.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Anecdote of the Prince of Peacocks
</title>
<text>
                    In the moonlight&lt;br&gt;
 I met Berserk,&lt;br&gt;
 In the moonlight&lt;br&gt;
 On the bushy plain.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Oh, sharp he was&lt;br&gt;
 As the sleepless!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 And, “Why are you red&lt;br&gt;
 In this milky blue?”&lt;br&gt;
 I said.&lt;br&gt;
 “Why sun-colored,&lt;br&gt;
 As if awake&lt;br&gt;
 In the midst of sleep?”&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 “You that wander,”&lt;br&gt;
 So he said,&lt;br&gt;
 “On the bushy plain,&lt;br&gt;
 Forget so soon.&lt;br&gt;
 But I set my traps&lt;br&gt;
 In the midst of dreams.”&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 I knew from this&lt;br&gt;
 That the blue ground&lt;br&gt;
 Was full of blocks&lt;br&gt;
 And blocking steel.&lt;br&gt;
 I knew the dread&lt;br&gt;
 Of the bushy plain,&lt;br&gt;
 And the beauty&lt;br&gt;
 Of the moonlight&lt;br&gt;
 Falling there,&lt;br&gt;
 Falling&lt;br&gt;
 As sleep falls&lt;br&gt;
 In the innocent air.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan&lt;br&gt;
 Of tan with henna hackles, halt!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Damned universal cock, as if the sun&lt;br&gt;
 Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal.&lt;br&gt;
 Your world is you. I am my world.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat!&lt;br&gt;
 Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines,&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs,&lt;br&gt;
 And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, (340)
</title>
<text>
                    I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,&lt;br&gt;
 And Mourners to and fro&lt;br&gt;
 Kept treading - treading - till it seemed&lt;br&gt;
 That Sense was breaking through -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 And when they all were seated,&lt;br&gt;
 A Service, like a Drum -&lt;br&gt;
 Kept beating - beating - till I thought&lt;br&gt;
 My mind was going numb -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 And then I heard them lift a Box&lt;br&gt;
 And creak across my Soul&lt;br&gt;
 With those same Boots of Lead, again,&lt;br&gt;
 Then Space - began to toll,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 As all the Heavens were a Bell,&lt;br&gt;
 And Being, but an Ear,&lt;br&gt;
 And I, and Silence, some strange Race,&lt;br&gt;
 Wrecked, solitary, here -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 And then a Plank in Reason, broke,&lt;br&gt;
 And I dropped down, and down -&lt;br&gt;
 And hit a World, at every plunge,&lt;br&gt;
 And Finished knowing - then -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    There is no Frigate like a Book (1286)

<text>
                    There is no Frigate like a Book&lt;br&gt;
 To take us Lands away&lt;br&gt;
 Nor any Coursers like a Page&lt;br&gt;
 Of prancing Poetry –&lt;br&gt;
 This Traverse may the poorest take&lt;br&gt;
 Without oppress of Toll –&lt;br&gt;
 How frugal is the Chariot&lt;br&gt;
 That bears the Human Soul –&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
