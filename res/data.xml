                    Nomad Exquisite
</title>
<text>
                    As the immense dew of Florida&lt;br&gt;
 Brings forth&lt;br&gt;
 The big-finned palm&lt;br&gt;
 And green vine angering for life,&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 As the immense dew of Florida&lt;br&gt;
 Brings forth hymn and hymn&lt;br&gt;
 From the beholder,&lt;br&gt;
 Beholding all these green sides&lt;br&gt;
 And gold sides of green sides,&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 And blessed mornings,&lt;br&gt;
 Meet for the eye of the young alligator,&lt;br&gt;
 And lightning colors&lt;br&gt;
 So, in me, come flinging&lt;br&gt;
 Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    The House Was Quiet and The World Was Calm
</title>
<text>
                    The house was quiet and the world was calm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The reader became the book; and summer night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;Was like the conscious being of the book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The house was quiet and the world was calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The words were spoken as if there was no book,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;Except that the reader leaned above the page,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The summer night is like a perfection of thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The house was quiet because it had to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;The access of perfection to the page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;In which there is no other meaning, itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;Is the reader leaning late and reading there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

                    Anecdote of the Jar
</title>
<text>
                    I placed a jar in Tennessee,&lt;br&gt;
 And round it was, upon a hill.&lt;br&gt;
 It made the slovenly wilderness&lt;br&gt;
 Surround that hill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The wilderness rose up to it,&lt;br&gt;
 And sprawled around, no longer wild.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was round upon the ground&lt;br&gt;
 And tall and of a port in air.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 It took dominion everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
 The jar was gray and bare.&lt;br&gt;
 It did not give of bird or bush,&lt;br&gt;
 Like nothing else in Tennessee.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan&lt;br&gt;
 Of tan with henna hackles, halt!&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Damned universal cock, as if the sun&lt;br&gt;
 Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Fat! Fat! Fat! Fat! I am the personal.&lt;br&gt;
 Your world is you. I am my world.&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 You ten-foot poet among inchlings. Fat!&lt;br&gt;
 Begone! An inchling bristles in these pines,&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
 Bristles, and points their Appalachian tangs,&lt;br&gt;
 And fears not portly Azcan nor his hoos.&lt;br&gt;

                    The Snow Man
</title>
<text>
                    One must have a mind of winter&lt;br&gt;
 To regard the frost and the boughs&lt;br&gt;
 Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 And have been cold a long time&lt;br&gt;
 To behold the junipers shagged with ice,&lt;br&gt;
 The spruces rough in the distant glitter&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Of the January sun; and not to think&lt;br&gt;
 Of any misery in the sound of the wind,&lt;br&gt;
 In the sound of a few leaves,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Which is the sound of the land&lt;br&gt;
 Full of the same wind&lt;br&gt;
 That is blowing in the same bare place&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 For the listener, who listens in the snow,&lt;br&gt;
 And, nothing himself, beholds&lt;br&gt;
 Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    This World is not Conclusion (373)
</title>
<text>
                    This World is not Conclusion.&lt;br&gt;
 A Species stands beyond - &lt;br&gt;
 Invisible, as Music -&lt;br&gt;
 But positive, as Sound -&lt;br&gt;
 It beckons, and it baffles - &lt;br&gt;
 Philosophy, dont know - &lt;br&gt;
 And through a Riddle, at the last - &lt;br&gt;
 Sagacity, must go -&lt;br&gt;
 To guess it, puzzles scholars -&lt;br&gt;
 To gain it, Men have borne&lt;br&gt;
 Contempt of Generations&lt;br&gt;
 And Crucifixion, shown -&lt;br&gt;
 Faith slips - and laughs, and rallies - &lt;br&gt;
 Blushes, if any see - &lt;br&gt;
 Plucks at a twig of Evidence - &lt;br&gt;
 And asks a Vane, the way - &lt;br&gt;
 Much Gesture, from the Pulpit -&lt;br&gt;
 Strong Hallelujahs roll - &lt;br&gt;
 Narcotics cannot still the Tooth&lt;br&gt;
 That nibbles at the soul -&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Much Madness is divinest Sense -&lt;br&gt;
 To a discerning Eye -&lt;br&gt;
 Much Sense - the starkest Madness -&lt;br&gt;
 ’Tis the Majority&lt;br&gt;
 In this, as all, prevail -&lt;br&gt;
 Assent - and you are sane -&lt;br&gt;
 Demur - you’re straightway dangerous -&lt;br&gt;
 And handled with a Chain -&lt;br&gt;

                    The Props assist the House (729)
</title>
<text>
                    The Props assist the House&lt;br&gt;
 Until the House is built&lt;br&gt;
 And then the Props withdraw&lt;br&gt;
 And adequate, erect,&lt;br&gt;
 The House support itself&lt;br&gt;
 And cease to recollect&lt;br&gt;
 The Augur and the Carpenter –&lt;br&gt;
 Just such a retrospect&lt;br&gt;
 Hath the perfected Life –&lt;br&gt;
 A Past of Plank and Nail&lt;br&gt;
 And slowness – then the scaffolds drop&lt;br&gt;
 Affirming it a Soul –&lt;br&gt;

                    the bruise will stop by later.&lt;br&gt;
 For now, the pain pauses in its round,&lt;br&gt;
 notes the time of day, the patient’s temperature,&lt;br&gt;
 leaves a memo for the surrogate: What the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 did you think you were doing? I mean . . .&lt;br&gt;
 Oh well, less said the better, they all say.&lt;br&gt;
 I’ll post this at the desk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 God will find the pattern and break it.&lt;br&gt;

                    This Room
</title>
<text>
                    The room I entered was a dream of this room.&lt;br&gt;
 Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine.&lt;br&gt;
 The oval portrait&lt;br&gt;
 of a dog was me at an early age.&lt;br&gt;
 Something shimmers, something is hushed up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 We had macaroni for lunch every day&lt;br&gt;
 except Sunday, when a small quail was induced&lt;br&gt;
 to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things?&lt;br&gt;
 You are not even here.&lt;br&gt;

                    Last Month
</title>
<text>
                    No changes of support—only&lt;br&gt;
 Patches of gray, here where sunlight fell.&lt;br&gt;
 The house seems heavier&lt;br&gt;
 Now that they have gone away.   &lt;br&gt;
 In fact it emptied in record time.   &lt;br&gt;
 When the flat table used to result&lt;br&gt;
 A match recedes, slowly, into the night.&lt;br&gt;
 The academy of the future is   &lt;br&gt;
 Opening its doors and willing&lt;br&gt;
 The fruitless sunlight streams into domes,   &lt;br&gt;
 The chairs piled high with books and papers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The sedate one is this month’s skittish one   &lt;br&gt;
 Confirming the property that,&lt;br&gt;
 A timeless value, has changed hands.&lt;br&gt;
 And you could have a new automobile&lt;br&gt;
 Ping pong set and garage, but the thief   &lt;br&gt;
 Stole everything like a miracle.&lt;br&gt;
 In his book there was a picture of treason only   &lt;br&gt;
 And in the garden, cries and colors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    Street Musicians
</title>
<text>
                    One died, and the soul was wrenched out   &lt;br&gt;
 Of the other in life, who, walking the streets   &lt;br&gt;
 Wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on   &lt;br&gt;
 The same corners, volumetrics, shadows   &lt;br&gt;
 Under trees. Farther than anyone was ever   &lt;br&gt;
 Called, through increasingly suburban airs   &lt;br&gt;
 And ways, with autumn falling over everything:   &lt;br&gt;
 The plush leaves the chattels in barrels   &lt;br&gt;
 Of an obscure family being evicted&lt;br&gt;
 Into the way it was, and is. The other beached   &lt;br&gt;
 Glimpses of what the other was up to:&lt;br&gt;
 Revelations at last. So they grew to hate and forget each other.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 So I cradle this average violin that knows   &lt;br&gt;
 Only forgotten showtunes, but argues&lt;br&gt;
 The possibility of free declamation anchored&lt;br&gt;
 To a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself   &lt;br&gt;
 In November, with the spaces among the days   &lt;br&gt;
 More literal, the meat more visible on the bone.   &lt;br&gt;
 Our question of a place of origin hangs&lt;br&gt;
 Like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests,&lt;br&gt;
 In coves with the water always seeping up, and left   &lt;br&gt;
 Our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared   &lt;br&gt;
 On the landscape, to make of us what we could.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

                    The Day Lady Died
</title>
<text>
                    It is 12:20 in New York a Friday&lt;br&gt;
 three days after Bastille day, yes&lt;br&gt;
 it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine&lt;br&gt;
 because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton   &lt;br&gt;
 at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner&lt;br&gt;
 and I don’t know the people who will feed me&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   &lt;br&gt;
 and have a hamburger and a malted and buy&lt;br&gt;
 an ugly &lt;small&gt;NEW WORLD WRITING&lt;/small&gt; to see what the poets   &lt;br&gt;
 in Ghana are doing these days&lt;br&gt;
                                                         I go on to the bank&lt;br&gt;
 and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)   &lt;br&gt;
 doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life   &lt;br&gt;
 and in the &lt;small&gt;GOLDEN GRIFFIN&lt;/small&gt; I get a little Verlaine   &lt;br&gt;
 for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do   &lt;br&gt;
 think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore or   &lt;br&gt;
 Brendan Behan’s new play or &lt;em&gt;Le Balcon&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Les Nègres&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine&lt;br&gt;
 after practically going to sleep with quandariness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 and for Mike I just stroll into the &lt;small&gt;PARK LANE&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and   &lt;br&gt;
 then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue   &lt;br&gt;
 and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and   &lt;br&gt;
 casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton&lt;br&gt;
 of Picayunes, and a &lt;small&gt;NEW YORK POST&lt;/small&gt; with her face on it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of&lt;br&gt;
 leaning on the john door in the &lt;small&gt;5 SPOT&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 while she whispered a song along the keyboard&lt;br&gt;
 to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
